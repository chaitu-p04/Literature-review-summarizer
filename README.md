# Literature-review-summarizer

This program automates the process of summarizing research papers by extracting key points from each section of the papers. It utilizes the Papers with Code API to search for papers based on a given query, downloads the PDFs of the papers, extracts the text from the PDFs, and generates a summary using the Google Generative AI API (gemini-2.0-flash model).
